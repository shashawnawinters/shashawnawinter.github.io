DESIGNER MATCH MASTER IS A MATCHING GAME WRITTEN WITH JAVASCRIPT


OBJECTIVE:

EACH CARD HAS IMAGES OF DIFFERENT RUNWAY LOOKS. IT IS THE PLAYER RESPONSIBILITY TO COMPLETE THE BOARD BY MATCHING ALL CARDS

WIREFRAME CONCEPT IS A 12 TILE LAYOUT BOARD WITH COLORED BACKGROUND AND CENTERED HEADING.
WHEN PAGE IS LOADED USER SHOULD SEE ALL CARD ARRANGED WITH LOGO SIDE UP. USER WILL BE ABLE TO START GAME BY CLICKING THE FIRST CARD TO REVEAL THE RUNWAY LOOK ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE. UPON CLICKING MATCHING CARDS THE CARDS WILL STAY FACE UP AND UPON CLICKING NON MATCHING COUNTERPARTS THE CARDS WILL FLIP BACK OVER. THE PROBLEMS I ENCOUNTERED WERE MAKING THE CARDS FLIP BACK OVER, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ADD A TIMER, GRAPHICS UPON WINNING AND A LINK TO THE WEBSITE.
